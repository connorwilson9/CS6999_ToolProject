# CS6999_ToolProject

## General Instructions to Run
You must install the following packages:
- express
- ejs
- mongodb
- body-parser

I will also need to upload your IP address to MongoDB for this to work fully. If you are working in the ITC Building, it should be fine. For the web app, make sure to start the server and wait until data is uploaded before visiting the site. Must rename WebApp Folder to "mongo-html" or edit the code.

If you have any issues with running, please let me know. 

## DataUploadCode

Contains the code that creates the initial data for the MongoDB document. The code reads from the CSV files to generate the data in the database. Also contains the classes for objects; however, I think I did not need to do this in the long run.

## WebApp

Contains the server and the .ejs file to run the web app.
